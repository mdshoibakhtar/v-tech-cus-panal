            <h4>Online Shopping on No Cost EMI at ETG</h4>
            <p>
              ETG has developed into a global player with a diverse portfolio of
              expertise across multiple industries, encompassing Agricultural
              inputs, logistics, merchandising and processing, supply chain
              optimization, digital transformation and energy. Our passion lies
              in the upliftment of farming communities; an unhindered commitment
              since establishment. Our promoters identified three challenges
              that supply chains in Africa faced and created a globalized
              business model around solutions addressing these obstacles. The
              first challenge identified was how to connect Small holder farmers
              with International Markets. In the early 80â€™s, the group started
              introducing small hubs and shops throughout rural areas.
